Reading Graph Data from File:

def read_graph_from_file(filename):
  with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    num_vertices, num_edges = map(int, lines[0].split())
    graph = Graph(num_vertices)
    for line in lines[1:]:
      u, v, weight = map(int, line.split())
      graph.add_edge(u, v, weight)
  return graph
