Dijkstra's Algorithm:

from heapq import heappush, heappop

def dijkstra(graph, src):
  dist = [float('inf')] * graph.V
  dist[src] = 0
  pq = [(dist[src], src)]

  while pq:
    u, _ = heappop(pq)

    for neighbor, weight in graph.adj[u]:
      alt = dist[u] + weight
      if alt < dist[neighbor]:
        dist[neighbor] = alt
        heappush(pq, (alt, neighbor))

  return dist
